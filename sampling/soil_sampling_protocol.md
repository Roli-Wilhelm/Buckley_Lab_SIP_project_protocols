Basic soil sampling protocol
============================

## Collecting soil

### Equipment

#### Required

* Soil corers
* Butter knife
* Ruler
* Ziplock bags
* Cooler 

#### Optional

* Ice (for cooler)
* Map of field(s)
* Rain poncho

### Method

* Soil cores can be taken along transects or random locations
  * Depends on sampling scheme
* Standard core depth: 5 cm
* Taking a soil core:
  * Push corer into ground
    * Make sure to sample deeper than needed
  * Pack topsoil down with corer
  * Pull out core, first twisting to ensure core separation
  * Measure core length needed
  * Use butter knife to remove excess core 
  * Place remaining core in ziplock bag
* Store ziplock bags of soil cores in cooler for transport back to the lab


## Soil sieving

>Goal: break down soil structure (homogenize) and combine samples from the same sample point.

### Equipment

* 2mm sieves (clean)
* Gloves
* Soil!

### Method

* Place soil on sieve
* Sift and mash soil through sieve
  * The sieve may need to be washed __and thoroughly dried__ periodically to prevent clogging
* Store soil in sterile containers


## Downstream sampling processing

### Freezing

* Aliquote soil into centrifuge tubes and freeze at -20<sup>o</sup>C or -80<sup>o</sup>C

### Geochemical analyses

* [Cornell Nutrient Analysis Laboratory](http://cnal.cals.cornell.edu/)

### Stable isotope analysis

* [Cornell Stable Isotope Laboratory](http://www.cobsil.com/)

### Determine soil dry weight (and water content)

* Place 10-30 g of soil on a weigh boat
  * Make sure to recore the weight
* Dry in drying oven for ~24 hrs
* Re-weigh the soil
* dry weight = original weight - dried weight

### Microcosm incubations

* Place soil into Erlenmeyer flasks
  * Amount of soil and size of flask is dependant on the experimental design
* Cover flasks with sterile foam stoppers
* Allow to de-gas for 14? days
* Stopper flasks with rubber stoppers
  * __Make sure:__ the seals are air tight
* SIP incubations & gas sampling:
  * See 'SIP_microcosm' protocol
