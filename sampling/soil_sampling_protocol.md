Basic soil sampling protocol
============================

## Collecting soil

### Equipment

#### Required

* Soil corers
* Butter knife (or similar)
* Ruler
* Ziplock bags
* Cooler
* Ice (for cooler)
* GPS device
* All-weather paper
* Clipboard
* Soil moisture probe
* Temperature probe
* Back-up batteries

#### Optional

* Map of field(s)
* Rain poncho(s)
* Sunscreen 


### Method

* Soil cores can be taken along transects or random locations.
  * Depends on sampling scheme.
* Standard core depth: 5 cm
* Taking a soil core:
  * Push corer into ground.
    * Make sure to sample deeper than needed.
  * Pack topsoil down with corer.
  * Pull out core, with first twisting to ensure core separation.
  * Measure core length needed.
  * Use butter knife to remove excess core .
  * Place remaining core in ziplock bag.
* Store ziplock bags of soil cores in cooler for transport back to the lab.
* Sieving may be done in the field depending on the distance to travel back to the lab.


## Soil sieving

>Goal: break down soil structure (homogenize) and combine samples from the same sample point.

### Equipment

* 2mm sieves (clean)
* Gloves
* Soil!

### Method

* Place soil on sieve.
* Sift and mash soil through sieve.
  * The sieve may need to be washed __and thoroughly dried__ periodically to prevent cloggin.
* Store soil in ziplock bags in the fridge until further processing.


## Downstream sampling processing

### Freezing

* Aliquote soil into centrifuge tubes and freeze at -20<sup>o</sup>C or -80<sup>o</sup>C

### Geochemical analyses

* [Cornell Nutrient Analysis Laboratory](http://cnal.cals.cornell.edu/)

### Stable isotope analysis

* [Cornell Stable Isotope Laboratory](http://www.cobsil.com/)

### Determine soil dry weight (and water content)

* Place 10-30 g of soil on a weigh boat.
  * 15 g soil seemed to work fine.
  * Make sure to recore the weight (don't tare the weigh boat).
* Dry in drying oven for ~24 hrs.
* Re-weigh the soil.
* dry weight = original weight - dried weight

#### Sean Berthrong's method for determining water holding capacity:

> I basically dried out the soil (you can either air dry or oven dry), 
and then put a filter paper in a funnel.
I sat the funnel in a beaker or flask and saturated the filter paper with DI.
I let the water drain and emptied the beaker. Then I got the mass of the wet filter+funnel+beaker. 
Then I added the dried soil to the filter funnel and saturated the soil with DI.
Let the soil free drain until it stops drippingâ€”how long depends on your soils,
but usually not more than a few minutes. Get the mass of the now wet soil plus apparatus,
the difference is the mass of water held. Hope that all makes sense.

* Sean's determination of 50% holding capacity for Penn Yan soil: 0.3 g (H2O) / g (soil)

### Microcosm incubations

* See 'SIP\_microcosm' protocol for detailed instructions.
* Place soil into Erlenmeyer flasks.
  * The amount of soil and size of flask is dependant on the experimental design.
* Cover flasks with sterile foam stoppers.
* Allow to de-gas for ~14 days.
  * Basically, just wait for the CO2 respiration rate to level off.
* Stopper flasks with rubber stoppers.
  * __Make sure:__ the seals are air tight.
* SIP incubations & gas sampling:
  * See 'SIP_microcosm' protocol
