Shared DNA Extraction Plates
•	If you have less than 96 samples for DNA extraction, samples can be loaded onto a shared plate.
•	Shared plates will go through DNA extraction once they are filled.
•	Each plate will have a labeled name and corresponding spreadsheet on a shared Google Doc.

Plate Naming
•	Plates will be named with the date the first samples are added in the following format:
o	Numerically – Day, Month, Year (eg. January 4, 2016 would be 04012016)
•	Plates will be labelled on both ends in Sharpie marker, or with a label.

Google Doc Management
•	Each plate will have one corresponding sheet in the Shared Plate Google Doc file.
•	If you are the first person to add samples to a shared plate, it is your responsibility to create the sheet on the DNA Extraction Shared Plates Google Doc.
•	Each sheet will have the following layout:
o	Plate name
o	Contact information for plate users
o	Plate diagram
o	Plate metadata
•	Users are responsible for adding their own sample names/numbers to the appropriate cell in the Google Doc worksheet.
•	Plate diagram will be updated post DNA extraction to inform users that their DNA is ready.
•	If you are the person to run the plate DNA extraction, it is your responsibility to inform all other plate users that their DNA is ready. 
•	Cell color coding will be used as follows:
o	White: Well is available to add sample.
o	Green: Well is occupied by sample and ready for extraction.
o	Blue: DNA has been extracted; samples in the labelled plate in the -20C freezer.
o	Orange: DNA has been removed from plate by user. If the entire plate is Orange, plate can be discarded.
•	It is the responsibility of the user who runs the plate DNA extraction to change color from green to blue.
•	If the entire plate is Orange, plate can be discarded.
•	If cells in the plate are Blue, continue to store plate in -20C freezer.
It is each user’s responsibility to update the plate Google Doc with these appropriate colors as quickly as possible.
