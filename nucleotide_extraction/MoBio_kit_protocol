Before Starting:
1.	Add -mercaptoethanol (B-ME) to PowerMag Microbiome lysis solution.
-	25l B-ME per 1ml lysis solution
-	64 ml total lysis solution needed per 96 well plate
-	Warm the Lysis Solytion at 60C 
2.	Briefly centrifuge (1 min at 4500 x g) the Glass Bead Plate to bring glass beads down into the well.
3.	Create sample map for 96 well plate.
4.	Add 0.25 g of each sample to appropriate well of 96 well plate.
*Note: sample plate can be stored in a -20 C freezer before DNA extractions.

Protocol:
1.	Add 650 l warmed PowerMag Microbiome Lysis Solution/B-ME to each well of the Glass Bead Plate.
2.	Secure a Bead Plate Sealing Mat to the Glass Bead Plate. Briefly vortex for 5 seconds.
3.	Place Glass Bead Plate in BioSpec BeadBeater. Beat for 1 min at maximum speed.
4.	Centrifuge Glass Bead Plate for 6 min at 4500 x g.
5.	Remove and discard Bead Plate Sealing Mat.
6.	Transfer supernatant to new 2ml Deep Well Plate (DWP). 
7.	Add 150 l PowerMag Inhibitor Removal Solution to each well and apply Sealing Tape to the DWP. 
8.	Vortex DWP for 5 seconds.
9.	Incubate DWP at 4C for 5 minutes.
10.	Centrifuge DWP for 6 min at 4500 x g.
11.	Remove and discard Sealing Tape.
12.	Avoiding the pellet, transfer the entire volume of supernatant to new DWP. 
13.	Apply Sealing Tape to DWP.
14.	Centrifuge for 6 min at 4500 x g.
15.	Transfer no more than 850 l supernatant to a new DWP, avoiding the pellet.
*Note: DWP can be stored at 4C for several hours at this stage.
16.	Add 875 l of Bead/Bind Solution to DWP.
17.	Shake for 10 min at 500 rpm. 
18.	Place DWP on Magnet.
19.	Incubate for 10 min on Magnet.
20.	Pipette 580 l from DWP to waste.
21.	Move plate to empty platform.
22.	Add 500 l Wash Solution to each well of DWP.
23.	Move plate back to Magnet. 
24.	Incubate for 10 min on Magnet. 
25.	Pipette 600 l from DWP to waste.
26.	Repeat steps 21-25 two more times.
27.	Move plate to empty platform.
28.	Add 100 l Elution Buffer to each well of DWP.
29.	Shake for 25 min at 500 rpm.
30.	Place DWP back on Magnet.
31.	Incubate for 10 min.
32.	Pipette 100 l from DWP to microplate.
