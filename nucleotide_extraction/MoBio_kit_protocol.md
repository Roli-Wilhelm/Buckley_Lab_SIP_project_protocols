# Before Starting:
1.	Add beta-mercaptoethanol (B-ME) to PowerMag Microbiome lysis solution.
  *	25 ul B-ME per 1 ml lysis solution
  * 64 ml total lysis solution needed per 96 well plate
  * Warm the Lysis Solytion at 60<sup>o</sup>C 
2.	Briefly centrifuge (1 min at 4500 x g) the Glass Bead Plate to bring glass beads down into the well.
3.	Create sample map for 96 well plate.
4.	Add 0.25 g of each sample to appropriate well of 96 well plate.
  * **Note:** sample plate can be stored in a -20<sup>o</sup>C freezer before DNA extractions.

# Protocol:
1.	Add 650 ul warmed PowerMag Microbiome Lysis Solution/B-ME to each well of the Glass Bead Plate.
2.	Secure a Bead Plate Sealing Mat to the Glass Bead Plate. Briefly vortex for 5 seconds.
3.	Place Glass Bead Plate in BioSpec BeadBeater. Beat for 1 min at maximum speed.
4.	Centrifuge Glass Bead Plate for 6 min at 4500 x g.
5.	Remove and discard Bead Plate Sealing Mat.
6.	Transfer supernatant to new 2 ml Deep Well Plate (DWP). 
7.	Add 150 ul PowerMag Inhibitor Removal Solution to each well and apply Sealing Tape to the DWP. 
8.	Vortex DWP for 5 seconds.
9.	Incubate DWP at 4<sup>o</sup>C for 5 minutes.
10.	Centrifuge DWP for 6 min at 4500 x g.
11.	Remove and discard Sealing Tape.
12.	Avoiding the pellet, transfer the entire volume of supernatant to new DWP. 
13.	Apply Sealing Tape to DWP.
14.	Centrifuge for 6 min at 4500 x g.
15.	Transfer no more than 850 ul supernatant to a new DWP, avoiding the pellet.
  * **Note:** DWP can be stored at 4<sup>o</sup>C for several hours at this stage.
16.	Add 875 ul of Bead/Bind Solution to DWP.
17.	Shake for 10 min at 500 rpm. 
18.	Place DWP on Magnet.
19.	Incubate for 10 min on Magnet.
20.	Pipette 580 ul from DWP to waste.
21.	Move plate to empty platform.
22.	Add 500 ul Wash Solution to each well of DWP.
23.	Move plate back to Magnet. 
24.	Incubate for 10 min on Magnet. 
25.	Pipette 600 ul from DWP to waste.
26.	Repeat steps 21-25 two more times.
27.	Move plate to empty platform.
28.	Add 100 ul Elution Buffer to each well of DWP.
29.	Shake for 25 min at 500 rpm.
30.	Place DWP back on Magnet.
31.	Incubate for 10 min.
32.	Pipette 100 ul from DWP to microplate.
