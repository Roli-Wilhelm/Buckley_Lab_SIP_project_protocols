See **Printing protocols** in the [README](../README.md#printing-protocols-conversion-of-protocols-to-pdf)


## Purpose
This protocol explains how to load the deep well 96-well plates with soil samples prior to bead beating and DNA extraction.  
The plates used should come from DNA MoBio kit already containing silica beads.  Once soils are loaded, DNA can be extracted using robot
(see MoBio_kit_protocol.md).


## Materials/Equipment
* Scale (.01g sensitivity)
* Weighing paper and/or small weighing boats
* Spatulas
* Glass stiring rods
* Well protectors (tip box top with drilled hole and microcentrifuge tube with end cut off inserted into hole.)
* Deep well 96-well plate (silica beads should already be inside wells)


## Protocol
1. Centrifuge plate before filling to make sure silica beads are at bottom (as per kit instructions).
1. Cut rubber plate cover into column strips.
1. Remove cover from first column and place well protector on top such that "funnel" is in first well.
    * Make sure most other wells are covered by lid or well protector.
1. Weigh out 0.25 g of soil.
1. Pour soil into well through funnel.
    * If soil is wet/muddy, it can be scraped into well with or without well protector.
    * If soil is sticky, it can be pushed through the funnel with glass stirring rod.
1. Carefully remove well protector.
1. Repeat for all soils.
    * Use a new well protector for each soil.
1. When column is done, put cover strip back and remove strip from next column.
1. Once all wells are done or if long break is required, put plate (covered) in -20ËšC freezer.


## Tips
1. Be very careful about static charge of plate.  It can cause dry soil particles to spread out to other wells or stick to covers.
1. For wet and sticky soils, weigh out 0.27-0.30 g instead to account for loss stuck to weighing paper and well protector.
1. For very wet soils, use weighing boats instead of paper.
1. For moist soil that clumps well, soil can be rolled up into cylinder shape in weighing paper and it falls neatly into well.
1. Place clean tip box cover over open wells during short breaks such as cleaning well protectors.
1. Keep soils on ice.
1. Only take out soils from freezer for 2-3 columns at a time to reduce effects from thawing.
1. Use many spatulas to save time of cleaning.


## Cleaning
* Between soils, thoroughly wipe out well protectors with 70% ethanol to remove any residual soils.
* Between soils, thoroughly wipe off spatulas and glass rods with 70% ethanol to remove residual soils.
* Before starting new plate, soak well protectors in 10% bleach solution for 20 min to remove residual DNA.
* Before starting new plate, flame sterilize spatulas.
