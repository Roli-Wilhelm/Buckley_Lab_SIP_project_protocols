## Application

The mineral content consists of the plant ash and soil particles that remain 
after removal of organic matter. The determination of organic matter by loss on ignition
is a taxonomic criterion for organic soil materials (Soil Survey Staff, 2014).


## Summary of Method

* Dry sample overnight at 110<sup>o</sup>C.
* Cool and weigh. 
* Place sample in a cold muffle furnace and raise the temperature to 400<sup>o</sup>C.
* Heat sample overnight (16 h), cool, and weigh.
* The ratio of the weights (400<sup>o</sup>C/110<sup>o</sup>C) is the mineral
content percentage.
* The Organic content % can be derived from the mineral content %.


## Interferences

The sample must be placed in a cold muffle furnace to prevent rapid 
combustion and sample splattering


## Safety

Use caution when the muffle furnace is hot.  Wear protective clothing and 
goggles.  Handle the heated material with tongs.


## Equipment

* Metal weighing tins
* Oven, 110<sup>o</sup>C
* Muffle furnace, 400<sup>o</sup>C
* Electronic Balance, 0.01-g sensitivity
* A lab notebook for recording values


## Procedure

1. Place a 10 to 15 g sample in a tared weighing tin.
1. Dry sample at 110<sup>o</sup>C overnight.
1. Remove sample from oven, cap, and cool in a desiccator.
1. When cool, record weight to nearest 0.01 g
1. Place sample and weighing tin in a cold muffle furnace. Raise temperature 
to 400<sup>o</sup>C.  Heat overnight (16 h).
1. Remove sample from oven, cap, and cool in a desiccator.
1. When cool, record sample weight to nearest 0.01 g.


## Calculations


* Mineral\_Content\_(%) = R<sub>W</sub> / OD<sub>W</sub> * 100
	* Where:
		* R<sub>W</sub> = Residue\_weight\_after\_ignition
		* OD<sub>W</sub> = Oven\_dry\_soil\_weight

* Organic matter percent can then be calculated as follows:
	* Organic\_Content\_(%) = 100 - Mineral\_Content\_(%)


# Report

Report mineral content to the nearest whole percent.
