Soil organic matter content
===========================

This is basically just a trimmed down version of the method in the
Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory Methods Manual, Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 42
Version 5.0, pages 495-497. Some details from 
[the SFU Soil Science Lab](https://www.sfu.ca/soils/lab_documents/Estimation_Of_Organic_Matter_By_LOI.pdf)
are also used.

## Application

The mineral content consists of the plant ash and soil particles that remain 
after removal of organic matter. The determination of organic matter by loss on ignition
is a taxonomic criterion for organic soil materials (Soil Survey Staff, 2014).


## Method overview

### Preparation

* Dry sample overnight at 110<sup>o</sup>C.
* Place samples in clean crucibles.
  * Record which sample is in which crucible.
* Weigh the sample + crucible.
  * This the the **pre-ignition weight (g)**

### Loss on ignition

* Place sample in a cold muffle furnace and raise the temperature to 400<sup>o</sup>C.
  * Optimum furnace ramp time is 5<sup>o</sup>C/min.
* Heat sample overnight (16 h)
* Once cooled, place samples in drying oven for >= 30 min
* Weigh the sample + crucible.
  * This the the **post-ignition weight (g)**

### Post 

* %\_organic\_matter = (pre-ignition\_weight - post-ignition\_weight) / 
pre-ignition\_weight * 100
* %\_mineral\_content = 100 - %\_organic\_matter

## Interferences

**NOTE:** The sample must be placed in a cold muffle furnace to prevent rapid 
combustion and sample splattering


## Safety

Use caution when the muffle furnace is hot.  Wear protective clothing and 
goggles.  Handle the heated material with tongs.


## Equipment

* Metal weighing tins (or better yet, crucibles)
* Oven, 110<sup>o</sup>C
* Muffle furnace, 400<sup>o</sup>C
* Electronic Balance, 0.01-g sensitivity
* A lab notebook for recording values


## Procedure

1. Place a 10 to 15 g sample in a tared weighing tin.
1. Dry sample at 110<sup>o</sup>C overnight.
1. Remove sample from oven, cap, and cool in a desiccator.
1. When cool, record weight to nearest 0.01 g
1. Place sample and weighing tin in a cold muffle furnace. Raise temperature 
to 400<sup>o</sup>C.  Heat overnight (16 h).
1. Remove sample from oven, cap, and cool in a desiccator.
1. When cool, record sample weight to nearest 0.01 g.
