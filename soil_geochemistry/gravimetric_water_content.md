## Supplies

* Soil samples (sieved)
* Weigh boats
* A milligram-scale 


## Method

* Write unique labels on each weigh boat.
	* 1 weigh boat needed per measurement.
* Weigh each weigh boat and write the weight on the boat.
	* This is needed to determine the dry weight.
* Place a pre-weighed weigh boat on the scale and tare (zero the scale).	
* Place 10 g of soil on the weigh boat.
	* It doesn't have to be exactly 10.0 g of soil, 
	just __MAKE SURE:__ to record the exact weight of the soil 
		* measurement = "soil wet weight"
* Repeat weighings for all soil samples		
* Dry soil samples in a drying oven for ~24 hrs.
* Re-weigh the samples (soil + weigh boat).
* Place the soils back in the drying oven for a few hours, then re-weigh.
	* Make sure that weight is stable.
* Subtract out the weight of the weigh boat
	* Resulting value = "soil dry weight"
* $$ 10 =  5 - \text{test} $$
* $\text{Water content (g)}  =  \text{soil wet weight (g)} - \text{soil dry weight (g)}$
* $\text{Water content (%)}  =  \text{water content (g)} / \text{soil wet weight}$
	* % as wet-weight basis; range is 0-100%
