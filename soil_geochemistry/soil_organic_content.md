Soil organic content
====================

This is basically just a trimmed down version of the method in the
Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory Methods Manual, Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 42
Version 5.0

## Application

The mineral content consists of the plant ash and soil particles that remain 
after removal of organic matter.  The percentage of organic matter lost on ignition 
can be used to define organic soils in place of estimates of organic matter by the 
Walkley-Black organic C method.  The determination of organic matter by loss on ignition
is a taxonomic criterion for organic soil materials (Soil Survey Staff, 2014).
Organic C data by Walkley-Black are generally considered invalid if organic C >8 %.


## Summary of Method

* Dry sample overnight at 110<sup>o</sup>C.
* Cool and weigh. 
* Place sample in a cold muffle furnace and raise the temperature to 400<sup>o</sup>C.
* Heat sample overnight (16 h), cool, and weigh.
* The ratio of the weights (400<sup>o</sup>C/110<sup>o</sup>C) is the mineral
content percentage.
* The Organic content % can be derived from the mineral content %.


## Interferences

The sample must be placed in a cold muffle furnace to prevent rapid 
combustion and sample splattering


## Safety

Use caution when the muffle furnace is hot.  Wear protective clothing and 
goggles.  Handle the heated material with tongs.


## Equipment

* Metal weighing tins
* Oven, 110<sup>o</sup>C
* Muffle furnace, 400<sup>o</sup>C
* Electronic Balance, 0.01-g sensitivity
* A lab notebook for recording values


## Procedure

1. Place a 10 to 15 g sample in a tared weighing tin.
1. Dry sample at 110<sup>o</sup>C overnight.
1. Remove sample from oven, cap, and cool in a desiccator.
1. When cool, record weight to nearest 0.01 g
1. Place sample and weighing tin in a cold muffle furnace. Raise temperature 
to 400<sup>o</sup>C.  Heat overnight (16 h).
1. Remove sample from oven, cap, and cool in a desiccator.
1. When cool, record sample weight to nearest 0.01 g.


## Calculations

* $\text{Mineral Content (%)} = (R_W / OD_W) * 100$
	* Where:
	* $R_W = \text{Residue weight after ignition}$
	* $OD_W = \text{Oven dry soil weight}$

* Organic matter percent can then be calculated as follows:
	* $\text{Organic Content (%)} = 100 - \text{Mineral Content (%)}$


# Report
