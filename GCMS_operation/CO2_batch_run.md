Protocol for quantifying CO2 in headspace samples with the Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010
===============================================================================

***

# Equipment 

* GCMS 
  * Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010

* Autosampler
  * Shimadzu AOC-5000 Auto Injector

***

# GCMS start up

## WARNINGS:

* You should not need to start the floor vacuum pump (rotory pump) manually.
This can be done using the GCMS software.

* If the GCMS has not been used in a while:
  * Check the oil level in the rotory vacuum pump (on the floor).
  

## Procedure:

1. Turn on carrier gas (should be Helium)
  * psi should be ~100
1. Turn on Shimadzu AOC-5000 Auto Injector
  * Make sure this is done BEFORE turning on the computer!
1. Turn on computer
1. Turn on GC and MS
1. Start the GCMS Real Time Analysis software

### Next step done in GCMS Real Time Analysis software

1. Vacuum control
  * Either Auto Startup or manual startup
    * Manual startup provides more control, option for safety checks, and may produce less wear and tear.
  * For Auto Startup, just click
  * Manual startup:
    1. Close vent valve
    1. Turn on rotory pump
       * less pressure drop to <10 pascals
    1. AFTER pressure is <10 pascals: turn on rotary pump
    1. Turn on ion source heater
     
1. Load a method or create a new method
  * Make sure that GC and MS are heating up to the method's specified temps
  * A batch file can then be created if needed

# GCMS tuning

## WARNINGS:

* If the GCMS has not been used in a long time (e.g., a year),
wait ~1 day prior to tuning.
  * TODO: why is wait needed?

## Procedure:

* Follow procedure starting on Page 21 of the GCMS-QP2010 Operation Guide.

### Leak check:

* Follow procedure outlined on Page 19 of the GCMS-QP2010 Operation Guide.

# GCMS sample processing

## Notes:

* The septum can be changed while the GC is on.
The carrier gas flow will just need to be turned
off very briefly prior to changing the septum.

***

# GCMS shut down

* Use auto shutdown or manual shutdown.
* Wait for the GC to cool before turning off the carrier gas.

***

# General notes

* The blue septa may provide a better seal than the green septa (for higher temps).
* The rotory vacuum oil should be changed every 6 months.
