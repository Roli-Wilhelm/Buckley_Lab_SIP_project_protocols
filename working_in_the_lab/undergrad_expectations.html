<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Be curious</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you have questions about the project or any else, ask them!</li>
<li>If you have any ideas for experiments to answer a question that you have about the project or anything else, talk to us and we may be able to make it happen.</li>
<li>Don't be afraid to ask questions during lab meetings. We want to help you understand what's going on.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Be a nerd</strong>
<ul>
<li>It's great to be excited about science!</li>
<li>We love talking about all kinds of nerdy topics, so don't be affaid to join in.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Be respectful of everyone's stuff</strong>
<ul>
<li>A shared work area should be as clean and organized as you found it.</li>
<li>Ask before you borrow an item, and be sure to return it to where to found it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ask, don't assume</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you are unclear about any work that you going to do (the details of the protocol, the concept behind the protocol, or how the work fits into the bigger project), <strong>ask us questions until you fully understand what you are doing</strong>!<br /></li>
<li>It doens't hurt to ask questions; however, making assumptions can lead to failed experiments, and wasted time, money, and effort.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Record what you do in the lab</strong>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to keep detailed notes in a lab notebook, excel sheet, or other means (use what's best for what you are doing).</li>
<li>Keep your records organized.</li>
<li>Here's some resources on recording you work in the lab:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~bioslabs/tools/notebook/notebook.html">Rice University: <em>Keeping a lab notebook</em></a></li>
<li><a href="http://misterguch.brinkster.net/sept2000.pdf">Lab notebook guide</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>When using a protocol, check off each task as you complete them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>If a protocol exists, use it</strong>
<ul>
<li>All protocols are freely available online at <a href="https://github.com/nyoungb2/Buckley_Lab_SIP_project_protocols">github.com/nyoungb2/Buckley_Lab_SIP_project_protocols</a>.</li>
<li>Following protocols is needed to make sure that the work is done <em>consistently</em>.</li>
<li>Make sure you have the most up-to-date protocol (check the github protocols for updates).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Label samples so that anyone can figure out what they are</strong>
<ul>
<li>Label everything with at least:
<ul>
<li>Sample identifier (Example: '13C cellulose')</li>
<li>The date</li>
<li>Your Cornell netID</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This applies in all cases, unless you are going to use the samples immediately.<br /></li>
<li>By reading the sample label and your lab notebook (or other records), anyone should be able to figure out what the sample is, even if it's 3 years since you labeled that sample.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Honor your work obligations</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you agree to work certain hours each week or if you agree to complete an experiment in a certain amount of time, you need to conform your schedule in a way that allows you to honor that obligation.</li>
<li>Unexpected events do happen (eg., you get sick), but it's your responsibility to make sure that either someone else can complete your work or that your work can be delayed.</li>
<li>While your education does come first, you should plan ahead with your schedule so that you have time to study and still honor your work obligations. This includes studying for finals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Be respectful of other's schedules</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you are scheduled to work at specific times during the day, come in at those times. Those times were designated for a reason (eg., so that we can check in with you, show you something in the lab, or help you during an experiment), and those times are not just guidelines.</li>
<li>Please let us know as soon as possible if you have to miss work for any reason (eg., a vacation or a class field trip).</li>
</ul></li>
