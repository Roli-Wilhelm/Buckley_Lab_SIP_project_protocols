<h1 id="lab-etiquette">Lab Etiquette</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Before you leave at the end of the day</strong>, walk around the lab to make sure that equipment is shut off and clean, and that shared work spaces that you have used have been cleaned up.</p></li>
<li><p>Tip/serological pipet waste goes into tip waste box.</p></li>
<li><p>Once tip waste is full, tape the box shut and bring it down to the dumpster in the basement.</p></li>
<li><p>Empty tip boxes are disposed of in the trash, unless they are reusable (P-10 white unfiltered tip boxes or P-200 yellow unfiltered tip boxes). Reusable boxes are placed in the box near the 2nd fume hood.</p></li>
<li><p>Both needles and syringes are to be placed in the sharps containers.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have borrowed equipment, make sure to return it.</p></li>
<li>If you notice that the lab is running low on a reagent/product, please write this information on the white board by the chemical shelf. Please included:
<ul>
<li>product name</li>
<li>product number for ordering</li>
<li>quantity needed to be ordered</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Autoclave culture waste.</p></li>
<li><p>After autoclaving, rinse out autoclave bins.</p></li>
<li>Label freezer boxes with at least:
<ul>
<li>project/sample name</li>
<li>your netID</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Dispose of phenol/chloroform in the appropriate waste container (chemical jug in the fume hood). If the container is getting full, notify Chantal (cnk29).</p></li>
<li><p>Use the sign-up sheets to block off time for using lab equipment.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure the equipment is shut off and clean when it is done being used for the day.</p></li>
<li><p>A designated undergrad will do the dishes and autoclaving unless they are not available.</p></li>
</ul>
