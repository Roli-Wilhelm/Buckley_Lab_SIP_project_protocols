</ul></li>

<p><strong>The desired density for solution:</strong> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=8.1000%20%28g%29%20%2F%204.3%20%28ml%29%20%3D%201.8837%20%28g%2Fml%29" alt="8.1000 (g) / 4.3 (ml) = 1.8837 (g/ml)" title="8.1000 (g) / 4.3 (ml) = 1.8837 (g/ml)" /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus, dissolve 8.1000g CsTFA in a total volume of 4.3 ml gradient buffer. Note, if you add 8.1000g of CsTFA to 4.3 ml buffer you will end up with a total volume of more than 4.3 ml. It is helpful to use a graduated tube or cylinder, start with less volume of gradient buffer than you need, add and dissolve the desired amount of CsCl, and then bring it up to your final volume.</p>

<li>Fine tune the density of your gradient media solution</li>

<p>Use the digital refractometer to achieve the <strong>EXACT</strong> gradient media density that you desire. To use: add 5 ul solution to sample well, making sure it covers completely the prism surface (it usually does). Press “read,” and it will give you the RI and temperature. The RI of water should be 1.3333. Wipe well with kimwipe after each sample. At the end of use add some water and then wipe clean. We have modified the surface of the prism with a piece of black electrical tape cut into the shape of a doughnut (cut with 2 cork borers of different radius).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First correct for the refractive index of your gradient buffer: All salts will cause refraction, in measuring the CsTFA density of our gradient media we need to first account for the refraction due to the gradient buffer (ie: the Tris, EDTA, and KCl). We do this by measuring the refractive index of the gradient buffer and then using the following equation:</p>

<pre><code>* Note CsTFA gets cold when it goes into solution. The equation above is only valid at 20C. Hence, you need to wait until the solution is near room temperature before measuring R&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;.

* The [R&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; corrected] of a 1.8000 CsTFA solution is 1.3713

* The above equation may not be universal for all batches of CsTFA and gradient buffer, due to differences in chemical batches and buffer concentration (correspondence between Chantal Koechli and Tillmann Lueders). Therefore, a single point standardization must also be done when preparing each batch of CsTFA solution This is done by weighing a fixed volume of solution as accurately as possible to determine the density. The best method is to use a small volumetric flask (1-5mL). Weigh a flask, fill, and cover with stopper to prevent evaporation (weigh stopper first). Then weigh the CsTFA as accurately as possible to determine density. Then measure the refractive index and calculate density from the equation. The difference between the two density values can be used as our correction factor (when converting from RI to density). </code></pre>
