<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Gluconoacetobacter xylinus was grown up on Heo and Son 0.1% glucose agar plates (using 12C-glucose) at 30<sup>o</sup>C without inositol (Heo and Son 2002).</li>
<li>Heo and Son liquid minimal media was made with 0.5% 0.1% glucose (make 1L as outlined in recipe).</li>
<li>Autoclave media and 10 foil covered 1L flasks</li>
<li>To increase surface area for cellulose growth, 100mL of the media was sterilely added to individual 1L Erlenmeyer flasks.</li>
<li>Each aliquot of media was inoculated with three isolated colonies of Gluconoacetobacter xylinus from Heo and Son plate.</li>
<li>Keep flasks static in the dark at 30<sup>o</sup>C for 2-3 weeks until thick cellulose pellicule forms.</li>

<h1 id="cellulose-harvest">Cellulose Harvest</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Pour off excess culture from cellulose growth flask</li>
<li>Make 1% Alconox solution</li>
<li>Add Alconox 2:1 with cellulose+ residual media (i.e. 200mL of 1% alconox for every 100mL media culture)</li>
<li>Autoclave for 30 minutes</li>
<li>Rinse under high pressure DI water faucet (~10 times, or until no suds being produced).
<ul>
<li>Use screen to hold over beaker to pour out water each time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At end of rinsing, fill beaker with DI H<sub>2</sub>O and cover.</li>
<li>Let sit for 12 hours at room temp, then rinse each beaker 3 times under high pressure DI.</li>
<li>Fill with water and let sit for another 12 hours. Repeat this for 2 days (i.e. ~4 rinsings total)</li>
<li>On the third day (after the 4<sup>th</sup> 12 hour soak), rinse cellulose about 3 times, then decant all liquids and put only the cellulose on a pre-weighed weighboat.</li>
<li>Cover weighboat with another weight to prevent contamination (especially of streptomyces spores)</li>
<li>Place in drying oven overnight</li>
<li>Weigh dried pellicules and calculate difference (from weighboat)</li>
