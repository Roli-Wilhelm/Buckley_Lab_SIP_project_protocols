# Cellulose Production

1. Plate *Gluconoacetobacter xylinus* glycerol stock onto Herstin and Schram agar plates. 
	* Incubation temp: 30<sup>o</sup>C 
	* Colonies should form within ~7 days
	* Only a few plates of media should be needed.
	* The rich media is used to get a healthy stock which is needed to grow well on the
  minimal Heo and Son media
1. Streak *Gluconoacetobacter xylinus* from single colonies grown on the Herstin 
and Schram media to Heo and Son 0.1% glucose agar plates. 
	* Media contains 0.5% v/v 12C-glucose and no inositol (Heo and Son 2002)
	* Incubation temp: 30<sup>o</sup>C 
3. Autoclave media and 10 foil covered 1L flasks 
4. Aliquot 100 mL of media to each 1L flask
	* Allows for a large liquid surface area for cellulose production
5. Inoculate each aliquot of media with three isolated colonies of *Gluconoacetobacter
xylinus* from Heo and Son plate. 
6. Keep flasks static in the dark at 30<sup>o</sup>C for 2-3 weeks until thick cellulose 
pellicule forms. 
	* **WARNING:** Any disturbance to the flasks may prevent/stop pellicule production


# Cellulose Harvest

1. Pour off excess culture from cellulose growth flask
2. Make 1% Alconox solution
3. Add Alconox 2:1 with cellulose+ residual media 
	* i.e., 200 mL of 1% alconox for every 100mL media culture
4. Autoclave for 30 minutes
5. Rinse under high pressure DI water faucet 
	* ~10 times, or until no suds being produced
	* Use screen to hold over beaker to pour out water each time. 
6. At end of rinsing, fill beaker with DI H<sub>2</sub>O and cover. 
7. Let sit for 12 hours at room temp, then rinse each beaker 3 times under high pressure DI.
8. Fill with water and let sit for another 12 hours. Repeat this for 2 days 
	* i.e., ~4 rinsings total
9. On the third day (after the 4<sup>th</sup> 12 hour soak), rinse cellulose 
about 3 times, then decant all liquids and put only the cellulose on a pre-weighed weighboat. 
10. Cover weighboat with another weight to prevent contamination 
(especially of streptomyces spores)
11. Place in drying oven overnight
12. Weigh dried pellicules and calculate difference (from weighboat)
