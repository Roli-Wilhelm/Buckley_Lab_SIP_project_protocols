<h2 id="warnings">WARNINGS</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to not cross-contaminate 13C cellulose on equipment used to measure natural abundances of isotopes!
<ul>
<li>You should use Buckley lab equipment for handling the cellulose, especially the 13C cellulose.</li>
<li>We have equipment designated to hold just 12C or just 13C cellulose.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make sure to not mix up 13C and 12C cellulose!
<ul>
<li>Everything should be labeled 12C or 13C.</li>
<li>Only grind 12C or 13C at a time and keep the isotopes separate!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cellulose-quality">Cellulose quality</h2>
<p>The <em>Gluconoacetobacter xylinus</em> cultures should produce clear or white-ish pellicules that look smooth and don't have much of an odor. Culture contamination can be identified as a brownish color, funky vinegar/sweet odors, or fuzzy areas on the pellicule. We currently are still harvesting all cultures unless the contamination is very prominant (eg., fuzzy cultures). The cellulose is designated into 2 tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>'Prime' cellulose</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cellulose from clear or white-ish pellicules that look smooth and don't have much of an odor</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>'Mediocre' cellulose</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cellullose from tan/brown-ish pellicules that may have a funky odors.</li>
<li>Fuzzy cultures should be disposed of.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Bacterial cellulose pellicules</li>
<li>Scissors</li>
<li>Bead beater</li>
<li>Bead beater canisters
<ul>
<li>There are canisters for just 12C or just 13C cellulose.</li>
<li>The canisters are marked with red and yellow tape, respectively.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Weighboats/weigh paper</li>
<li>Scale</li>
<li>250 um sieves
<ul>
<li>There sieves for just 12C or just 13C cellulose.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Glass plates or large weight paper to collect the sieved cellulose.</li>
<li>Scintillation vials for holding ground cellulose.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Pre-weigh the scintillation vials so that you can measure the cellulose yield after grinding.
<ul>
<li>Record the weights.</li>
<li><strong>MAKE SURE:</strong> Mark each vial as either 12C or 13C.</li>
<li>Also, mark each vial with the date and whether the cellulose is 'prime' or 'mediocre'.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cut cellulose with sterilized scissors into small confetti pieces</li>
<li>Weigh out ~50 mg portions for grinding
<ul>
<li>Too much cellulose will cause clogging in the canister.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add to appropriate bead beater canister (12C or 13C).
<ul>
<li>The canisters are marked with red and yellow tape, respectively.</li>
<li><strong>MAKE SURE:</strong> Use the correct canister.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Place in bead beater machine (in Laurie Drinkwater lab) and bead for 1.5 min.</li>
<li>Place the sieve (use the appropriate sieve: 12C or 13C) on a glass plate or weigh paper.</li>
<li>Sift the ground cellulose through a 250 um sieve.
<ul>
<li>Anything that goes through the sieve gets put in a labeled scintillation vial.</li>
<li>Anything that remains in the sieve needs to be re-ground and re-sieved.</li>
<li>The sieving is to make sure the particle size is representative of particulate organic matter (POM) that microbes would experience in their natural environment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do until all cellulose confetti has been ground.</li>
<li>Weigh the vials containing cellulose to determine the total yeild of ground cellulose.
<ul>
<li>Record the cellulose yield.</li>
</ul></li>
