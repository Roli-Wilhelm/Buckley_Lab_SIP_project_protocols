<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Cut cellulose with sterilized scissors into small confetti pieces</li>
<li>Weigh out 50 mg portions for grinding</li>
<li>Add to appropriate vial (12C or 13C), mark with red and yellow tape respectively.</li>
<li>Place in bead beater machine (in Laurie Drinkwater lab) and bead for 1.5 min.</li>
<li>Sift through 250 um sieve, anything that goes through gets put in a jar. Anything that remains in the sieve needs to be re-ground.
<ul>
<li>This is to make sure the particle size is representative of particulate organic matter (POM) that microbes would experience in their natural environment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do until all cellulose confetti has been ground.</li>
</ol>
